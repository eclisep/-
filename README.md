The World Internet Development Report 2022 released during the Wuzhen Summit of the World Internet Conference 2022 showed that in the first quarter of 2022, the number of global 5G users increased by 70 million, reaching about 620 million, and the 5G population coverage rate exceeded 25%. According to the forecasts of Ericsson and the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), the number of global 5G users will exceed 1 billion by the end of 2022. For telecommunications operators, facing such a huge 5G market, it is also very helpful to conduct user profiling based on some user-side information and further conduct precise marketing for potential 5G users.
